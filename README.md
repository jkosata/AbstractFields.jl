This is a simple package to enable declaring fields for abstract types in Julia, see https://github.com/JuliaLang/julia/issues/4935

To do list:
    - ensure compatibility with Parameters.jl
    - add more input checks
    - possibly add option to disable abstract type creation (i.e., use macro only)
